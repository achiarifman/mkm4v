  \       <SeriesName>The 1970s Office</SeriesName>\n        <Overview>It hardly bears
  thinking about, but just imagine having to live without all the technology that
  we take for granted. We panic when we go to work and discover that we've left our
  mobile phones at home. We're enraged when our computers crash and we can't order
  our weekly shopping over the web. Once upon a time there was a strange world without
  computers, mobiles and the internet. Instead of bluetooth keyboards there were typewriters.
  The only way to get money from your bank was to stand in a queue and write a cheque.
  But we're bringing that scary world back to life in The 1970s Office, a retro-scripted
  reality series that will celebrate the awfulness (and the richness) of the recent
  past. We'll do this by meticulously recreating the typical 70s office and installing
  a bunch of fickle, precious and competitive admen for the toughest test of their
  careers. Assigned that seventies' favourite, The Space Hopper, they will work towards
  their ad campaign pitch. For two weeks,</Overview>\n        <FirstAired>2004-10-01</FirstAired>\n
